Previous entries such as Fish-o-tron focused on technical ability to measure fish with a smart phone. Our Project focuses on social appeal and an algorithm for identifying specific fish species.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n####[Links]\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n#####Summision on [DevPost.com](http://devpost.com/software/great-catch)\r\n<br>\r\n#####U.S. Department of State Problem Statements  [here](https://challenges.s3.amazonaws.com/fishackathon/2016%20Fishackathon%20Final%20Problem%20Statements.pdf)\r\n<br>\r\n#####Fishackathon Main Website [fishackathon.co](http://www.fishackathon.co/)\r\n\r\n",
